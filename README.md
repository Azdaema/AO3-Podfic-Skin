# AO3-Podfic-Skin
Format podfic posts with cover art on AO3. Written by me.

| Folder | Blurb
| -----: | ----- |
| [standard](./standard) | On a screen that's wide enough (900px or more) it has the cover art on the left and the details on the right. On a smaller screen (ie. phones) the cover art goes above and the details go below.
| [without cover art](./without%20cover%20art) | For posting podfics without cover art in vaugely the same style.
| [multi-chapter](./multi-chapter) | Tables! For ongoing, multi-chapter podfics. Stick this code onto the end of `standard` or `without cover art`
